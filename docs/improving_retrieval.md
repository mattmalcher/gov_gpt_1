Things that could help bring back more relevant content:

* better embeddings
* different chunk parameters
* augmenting with linked content
    * either using topic taxonomy or with page links, or both
* additional datasets
    * legislation
    * forums?
    * any open sources of interaction - think answered FOIA requests?
