     """Yet another multiple LISAs across tax years query for you all

    Hi everyone,

    I currently have a stocks and shares LISA which I paid £4k into last tax year (2022/23) just ended. Now the new tax year is upon us, I know i can add another £4k. However i don’t want to invest this time and just want a simple Cash LISA for 2023/24, which i would need to open now, rather than adding another £4k to the S&S one.

    I know you can pay into each type of ISA (so long as only one of each specific type in the tax year), subject to the £20k max, but would I be able to have multiple LISAs of different types open at once?

    I don’t believe having the arrangement below is an issue when it comes to realising the funds and bonuses when I want to buy (i.e i can’t only use one of the LISAs for a <450k property), but happy to be told otherwise aswell! S&S LISA (2022/23) Cash LISA (2023/24)

    Thanks!

# Tax refund on SIPP Contributions

    "question":
     """So my accountant has asked me to check with a financial advisor, which seems a bit strange given I though this was their job, but I can't find an answer to this complicated question anywhere. So I'm going to try and explain it and see if anyone knows the answer:

    So to keep it really simple... let's assume that for the last 3 tax years I have not contributed anything to a pension, but have been earning £100,000 for each of the last 3 years (including the current tax year just ending).

    Using some spare cash, I then contribute £100,000 to a SIPP which is immediately topped up with 20% tax contribution by the SIPP provider. This fills up my pension contribution of £40k for the last 3 years.

    Using self assessment, I can then claim back an additional 20% of the £40k for this current tax year - but can I do it for the previous years? And if so, do I do it from the current year's self assessment?

    The reality is more complicated, but so far my accountant has only claimed back on a SA for the latest year of tax owed, not on the additional contributions (which are a bit more complicated to work out). I just want to check it is possible before digging into tax codes, pension contributions, salaries etc.

    Thanks all.

# £450k limit on LISA benefits

    Me and my GF had an offer on a house (£468k) accepted.

    I have been saving in a LISA and I see now the limit on the house price is £450k

    6 years ago when I started the account I did not ever imagine I would be buying a house for more then £450k and obviously since the crazy cost rises in the economy the LISA didn’t adjust.

    Now I’m feeling like I’ve been taken for an absolute mug.

    Is there any way I can limit the losses?
